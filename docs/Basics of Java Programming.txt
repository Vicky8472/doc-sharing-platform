Basics of Java Programming
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its portability, scalability, and security. It is widely used in building large-scale enterprise applications, Android apps, and web-based applications.

1. Structure of a Java Program
A basic Java program consists of classes and methods. Every Java application must have a main() method, which serves as the entry point for execution. Java code is usually enclosed in classes, and these classes contain methods that define the program's behavior.

2. Data Types
Java supports a range of data types:

Primitive types: int, float, double, char, boolean
Non-primitive types: String, Arrays, and custom classes.
Java is a statically typed language, meaning you must declare the type of each variable explicitly.

3. Variables
Variables are used to store data. In Java, you must declare a variable with a specific type before using it.

4. Operators
Java supports the following operators:

Arithmetic Operators: For mathematical operations.
Relational Operators: For comparisons like equality and inequality.
Logical Operators: For logical operations (&&, ||, !).
Assignment Operators: For assigning values to variables.
5. Control Structures
Java includes various control structures:

If-else: For decision-making.
Switch: For handling multiple conditions.
Loops: Java provides for, while, and do-while loops for iteration.
6. Functions (Methods)
In Java, functions are called methods. Methods are defined within a class and can be called using an object or directly using a class name if they are static.

7. Object-Oriented Programming
Java is a fully object-oriented language. You can create classes to represent objects, and those classes can have properties (fields) and behaviors (methods). Java supports concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

8. Arrays
Arrays in Java are used to store multiple values in a single variable. Java arrays are fixed in size and can store elements of the same type.

9. Input and Output
System.out.println() is used for displaying output.
Scanner class is used to take user input.
10. Comments
Java uses // for single-line comments and /* */ for multi-line comments.

Conclusion
Java is a robust, platform-independent language with a rich set of libraries. Itâ€™s ideal for building scalable, secure applications and remains one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.
